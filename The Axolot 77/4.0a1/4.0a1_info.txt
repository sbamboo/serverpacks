This resourcepack includes assets/content from other resourcepacks, some are included in full and some only have selected parts included.
The authors of the merged packs remains in full ownership of their packs/assets and remains with the right to contact me to remove the pack from the merge.

Any assets not included from a merge-in or contribution is made by the author and the author remains in ownership.

This resourcepack is created using my indev resourcepack generator, thus the final resourcepack is generated from the assets and a project config.
Source assets for this resourcepack is avaliable at the same place the resourcepack was generated from.
